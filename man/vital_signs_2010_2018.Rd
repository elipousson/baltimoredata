\description{
The Baltimore Neighborhood Indicator Alliance (BNIA) describes the Vital
Signs are "data-points compiled from a variety of reliable sources that 'take
the pulse' of Baltimoreâ€™s neighborhoods." This data set is based on the Vital
Signs Data Tables (2010-2018) master Excel file containing all Vital Signs
indicators, by year of release.
}
\details{
The source file contained the full name of the indicator, values for
Baltimore City and all 55 of the Community Statistical Areas (CSAs). Due to
COVID-19, the publication of the Vital Signs 18 indicators has been staggered
and this data does not yet contain full housing or education data. CSAs with
missing data in the Excel file appear as `NA` values in this dataset.
